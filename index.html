            The first model we created was a multiple linear regression model.
            This model took the aroma, appearance, palate, taste, and abv columns. The training score for this model was 0.656, and the testing score was 0.662.
            The first graph displays the model's predicted values with the difference between the predicted and test values.
            This first model has a mean squared error of 0.125, which suggests the model can come close to accurately predicting the overall scores.
        </p>

    <div id="plot1"></div>
    <div>
        <p>
            In an attempt to improve our model, we examined the weight of each coefficient. We found the palate and the taste had the most significant impacts on the model.
            The second graph shows a similar pattern to the first model.
            The MSE of our second model was 0.128, again, similar to the previous example.
            Both models performed well at predicting the overall score.

    <h3>Neural Network Model</h3>
    <h4>Model Composition</h4>
    <p>
        We set up a neural network model to see how it would compare to the MLR model. 
        The model consisted of 2 hidden layers (20 nodes each) with a 'relu' activation function and a sigmoid output layer.
        The model was trained on the same data as the MLR but scaled using the sklearn 'StandardScaler' function. 
    </p>
    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>
        The model achieved a MSE of between 7.9 and 8.1 depending on the run. We tried adding 'beer_style' as a feature to see if 
        it would improve the model. There were 103 styles so we dropped the styles with less than 100 entries leaving us with 13.
        Using the sklearn OneHotEncoder function we converted the data and fed it into the model. Unfortunately the model did not react perceptibly to the new features. 
        Altering the epochs, node count, and activation functions did not yield anything better than a 7.9 MSE.<br>
        We conclude that a neural network is perhaps overcomplicated for this problem and that a MLR is better suited for this prediction.

        Our Process
    </h1>

    <p id="process">
        - Discuss initial attempts at MLR
            - What changed from the first models to the last. (Removing data/rows)
            - Changing model to predict scores from individual review with highest review count.
        - Discuss NN ideas
            - Choosing to bin beer_styles to try and improve accuracy.
